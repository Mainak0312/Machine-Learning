    "The LITES model is a central application used by the XVA Trading Desk to calculate and allocate valuation adjustments across asset classes, and by Valuation Product Control (VPC) to generate an independent view of Front Office results through EnLITEN. These outputs serve two main business purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk Management and Performance Monitoring – XVA results, together with PAA (Profit Attribution Analysis), allow the desk to attribute daily P&L to key risk factors. This enables traders and controllers to identify whether changes in P&L are driven by expected sensitivities (e.g., delta, vega, credit spreads) or unexplained residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regulatory and Control Processes – PAA forms an integral part of the model performance monitoring framework. VPC relies on these outputs in its monthly Operational Control Summary and in regulatory reporting processes to demonstrate that XVA models are functioning as intended, with unexplained P&L remaining within acceptable tolerance levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue identified by MRM—that LITES was unable to calculate XVA PAA for equity products—impacted the second dimension above (performance monitoring and controls) rather than the actual model valuation output. While the valuation of equity-linked XVA exposures was captured correctly, the absence of equity risk factors from PAA meant that movements in equity portfolios could appear as unexplained P&L. This reduced transparency in performance attribution and created the potential for control gaps, especially in scenarios where equity exposures grew in size or volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the materiality of equity exposures was historically low (due to ECCH trades being excluded from LITES and handled separately), the lack of equity PAA limited the ability of VPC to fully validate and explain daily P&L movements. This increased reliance on manual monitoring of portfolio size and risk, and represented a recurring Severity 3 control issue in validation reviews until the recent remediation steps"

    "The LITES framework combines exposure simulation, aggregation, and XVA calculation, with PAA functionality providing attribution of daily P&L to risk sensitivities across asset classes. While valuations for equity-linked XVA exposures were captured within this framework, the PAA component was unable to generate equity sensitivities, leaving equity-driven P&L unexplained. The remediation extended the framework by adding equity delta shocks for single-name exposures and establishing monitoring thresholds, thereby closing the gap between valuation and performance attribution."

    "Model Risk Management (MRM) highlighted the absence of equity sensitivities in LITES PAA as a control weakness. While the model correctly valued equity-linked XVA exposures, the inability to attribute P&L to equity risk factors meant that equity-driven movements appeared as unexplained P&L. This weakened performance monitoring and created the risk that material equity exposures could go undetected.\n",

    "Agreed Remediation Plan\n",
    "To address this, Model Developers enhanced LITES to include equity delta shocks for counterparties with single-name exposures (covering ~95% of equity risk). VPC committed to monitor equity P&L attribution monthly against defined thresholds (≥85% single-name coverage and ≤USD 10k materiality). If these thresholds are breached, further equity risk shocks will be implemented. The monitoring results will be reported through VPC’s monthly XVA Operational Control Summary."

    "The agreed remediation plan required the Model Developers (MD) to establish a process for monitoring the materiality of the equity component of XVA and to introduce additional risk shocks should monitoring results demonstrate that further action is necessary. In alignment with this plan, functionality was implemented in the July 25, 2025 LITES release to incorporate equity delta risks for counterparties with exposure to a single equity ticker into the XVA PAA output. This enhancement is expected to trigger a review under MOD-28848-v3.00-MET-07186 and will be submitted to Model Risk Management (MRM) through Valuation Product Control’s (VPC) month-end trigger monitoring process. In addition, VPC has established a recurring control to monitor the aggregate equity risk profile and to report results within its monthly XVA Operational Control Summary."
