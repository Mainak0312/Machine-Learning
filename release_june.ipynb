    "4. Does the actual observation hour setting now align with market trading hours across exchanges? How does the model handle different markets (e.g., US vs. Asia)?\n",
    "5. What happens if a product is set with AmericanObsHoursPerDay = 0, but its calendar time to maturity is less than 1 day? Is that handled properly?\n",
    "6. Once americanObsDt is computed, can you explain how it is fed into the PDE grid or ctsBarrierHitPct calculation? Is it treated as the total monitoring time?\n",
    "7. Previously, was a fixed dt used for every barrier monitoring interval? Does the new implementation allow varying dt that reflects actual elapsed time (e.g., 3 days vs. 1 day)?\n",
    "8. Have you compared the new results against analytical barrier models or market prices to confirm that using actual time improves accuracy? If so, please provide us the test. "
